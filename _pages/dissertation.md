Thank you for being interested in participating the project.  

I am collecting body measurement data from female college students to support my dissertation research. You data will be collected in **room 3412 at College of Textiles, NC State University**. The whole process takes around **15-20 minutes** and you will get a **free T-shirt**. 

You can find a digital copy of the consent form by clicking [HERE](https://drive.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/file/d/0By1ZOfLoXEBbd3FON1M4SjluR3M/view?usp=sharing). You will be asked to read and sign a paper copy of the consent form when you come for body scanning. 

Details regarding the process:  
An eight digital code will be generated and linked to the data. The data that will be collected from each participant includes:  
1) **basic information** (age, sex, ethnicity, weight, height, and whether you are currently enrolled as a college student or not) collected through a questionnaire, a weight scale, and a wall-mounted ruler;  
2) **body measurement data** in the format of two 3D point cloud models (one wearing the participantâ€™s underwear and the other wearing the provided scan garments) collected through the Size Stream body scanner;  
3) and **two 2D images** of the participant wearing a provided mask and scan garments taken with a cellphone provided by the researcher.  

For any questions, please contact me at sxia2@ncsu.edu. I appreciate your time and support. Look forward to your participation.
