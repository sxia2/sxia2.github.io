<strong>Welcome!</strong>

<p>My name is Sibei Xia. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Textile Technology Management at North Carolina State University. I have a Master of Computer Science degree and a Master of Science degree in Textiles. My research focuses on using data mining, body scanning, and image processing techniques to automate size and fit of apparels. My career goal is to either stay in academia or work in a company, where I can contribute its focus on emerging technologies.</p>
