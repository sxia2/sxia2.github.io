<strong>Welcome!</strong>

<p>My name is Sibei Xia. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Textile Technology Management at North Carolina State University. I have a Master of Computer Science degree and a Master of Science degree in Textiles. My research focuses on using data mining, body scanning, and image processing techniques to automate size and fit of apparels. My career goal is to stay in academia, where I can contribute to its focus on teaching, scholarship, learning, and inclusion. I would continue my research on merging apparel design and computer science, and lead campus and professional service activities.</p>
